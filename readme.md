# Background
having a cell phone plan is expensive. not only is it expensive, but
it is hard to find what plan offers the best deal considering your
needs. So why not make a web app to compare phone plans?

# Design
We need to be able to specify what we need and then see a comparison
of the different plans, so we can effectively look at the cost vs.
the quality of each option.

## Specifying our needs
There are a number of requirements we might have when looking for a cell
plan. We should support the most common first.

1. multiple devices. Each device should have:
   1. Domestic usage
      1. number of minutes
      2. number of texts
      3. amount of data
   2. type of phone
      1. basic vs smartphone
      2. type of smartphone
2. carrier


## Listing the competition
Once a user has specified what they want, we should list the possible
options, sorted by price.
